# Neovim modules for logging & testing
--------------------------------------
These are very simple modules which I have used in my neovim configuration for
logging and testing purposes in as I didn't want to use any library for these. 
Also, I wanted to learn more about lua and neovim config hence I developed these.

You may use/modify/extend these modules in your code, but I would advise you to
use any well tested and famous library for these purposes if you are developing 
for production.

## Modules
* LLogger [See usage](/lua/llogger/README.md)
* LAssert [See usage](/lua/lassert/README.md)

**PRs & feature enhancements are welcome**
